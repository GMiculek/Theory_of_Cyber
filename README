TLDR: Just run main.py with no additional initial args

Overview:
This python code is the implementation of the algorithms
presented in "Situational Awareness for Smart Home IoT 
Security via Finite State Automata Based Attack Modeling",
created by F. James, I. Ray and D. Medhi and published
by IEEE (full citation below). There are four python files,
labeled main, Access_Attack, Authentication_Attack, and
Confidentiality_Attack. Main is the unifying body of the
program, which when run asks the user which attack they
wish to perform, and executes that attack by calling the
respective python file. It also handles restarting of the
program if the user wishes to run multiple attacks in
sequence. Each of the other three python files contain the
functions and code necessary to simulate one of the three
attack FSA's provided in the original paper.
